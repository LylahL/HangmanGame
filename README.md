This is a technical test problem for BYU OIT student programer application

## Time Breakdown
- **Total Hours: 3**

  1. **Pseudocode Drafting: 30 minutes**
     - Created a basic outline that initially had logic errors.

  2. **Coding: 1.5 hours**
     - Translated the pseudocode while fixing errors.

  3. **Debugging: 1 hour**
     - Fixed deeper errors and syntax.
    
## Documentation
  they are in the executable: docstrings and comments.

## Future Improvements
  find a way to fix the draw_bodypart function, you can not just write a list and tell people to use their imagination...
  which I will address this in a separate file for future updates, not the ver1.0, that's what I accomplished within the 4-hour time limit.
  maybe during thanksgiving break.
